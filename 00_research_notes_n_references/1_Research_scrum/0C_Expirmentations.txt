#C General Conclusion on Caches/Prefetchers:
    Conclusion on Caches/Prefetchers: Caches are direction-agnostic, but prefetchers are typically better optimized for forward sequential access due to its prevalence in code. Backward access is still well-supported on modern CPUs, but prefetching may be slightly less efficient (e.g., higher latency to detect the pattern or fewer prefetched lines. 

    Conclusion... apparenlty to AI: Evidence from Hardware Documentation: Intel’s optimization manuals (e.g., Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual) note that prefetchers like the L2 streaming prefetcher can handle both directions but are tuned for forward access. AMD’s Zen documentation similarly indicates that prefetchers adapt to descending patterns, though forward access is the primary optimization target.


#C Expirmentations: 
  For very large arrays (e.g., ~471M doubles), forward access is consistently faster, especially with vectorization, since prefetching and SIMD optimizations are designed for it. This effect becomes most noticeable at larger sizes where prefetch algorithms are more effective.

  For mid-sized arrays, in non-vectorized code, backward access can trend faster, though large strides degrade performance.Then For small, cache-resident arrays, access direction makes little difference.
  
  So IG: Use forward access for vectorized code.For non-vectorized code, backward access may help on mid-sized arrays. On small arrays, it’s negligible.

  OOH and SIMD is HEAVILY FAVORS foward fetching.
