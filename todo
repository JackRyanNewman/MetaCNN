Scrum-to do list. 

1. Make it so, that we can swap mini_batches instead, and alternate between that, and custom threaded method to swap within class boundaries.
2. Evualute memory before hand, so we can create x+files of .bin's, so we alterante between them,  IF files are way to large, we can look intto windowsSotage Direct. 
3. Explore GPU options. 
4. Intergate tool into pytorch pipieline? 
6. Implementedd workshoped
  6.1 CNN Archecture. 
  6.2 
    Create python function, to create our defines for unique foward+back_ward + specific activation functions. 
    Then write those functions as a static arrayy, then loop unroll them in our train process. 
    With this, our marco will generate unique pairs, and will competely dirvurtilize our data!  
  6.3: Multi-styled batches: comments. 
  6.4: Deployed optimization Kernel mutplication stradagies. Do FFT anyslsis for tvm
  6.5 Emmploy data set size anyslis for optminal sizing. 
7. Mabye make varibles static for future interactions, declare externs for clarities?? 

Alwayys check up on compiler optimizations.
